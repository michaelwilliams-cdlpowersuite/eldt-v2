- ✅ Memoized calculations for performance
- ✅ Functional components with clear props
- ✅ Single responsibility principle

### 3. **Code Organization**
- ✅ Feature-based folder structure
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Reusable UI components
- ✅ Centralized business logic

### 4. **Maintainability**
- ✅ Easy to find and modify specific functionality
- ✅ Clear file organization
- ✅ Reduced cognitive load
- ✅ Better developer experience

## 📊 **Before vs After**

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **File Size** | 1,424 lines | ~1,000 lines (distributed) |
| **TypeScript** | `any` types everywhere | Proper interfaces |
| **Organization** | Everything in one file | Modular structure |
| **Reusability** | None | Reusable components |
| **Testability** | Difficult | Easy to test |
| **Performance** | Unoptimized | Memoized calculations |

## 🔧 **Components Created**

### **Core Components**
- `OptionCard` - Reusable card for course/theory selection
- `CheckboxOptionCard` - Reusable card for endorsement selection
- `ModernProgressBar` - Progress indicator
- `SummaryLine` - Summary display component

### **Step Components**
- `Step1_MainCourse` - Course selection
- `Step2_Theory` - Theory option selection
- `Step3_Endorsements` - Endorsement selection
- `Step4_UpgradeSave` - Summary and upgrade options
- `Step5_Payment` - Account creation and payment

### **Business Logic**
- `useCheckout` - Custom hook for all state and calculations

## 🚀 **Benefits Achieved**

### **For Developers**
- **Easier to understand**: Clear file structure and naming
